# Hi! I’m Doran!

Well, you’ve found my website. So, you may actually want to know more about me.

_Maybe._

I’m a creative kind of guy. I like to play guitar. I like to draw an paint. I like to build things out of wood. And I write this blog and the comics that go on it. Between this, my three kids, two dogs, a wonderful wife who’s kicking ass in Grad School, I keep busy.

**- BUT -**

If you’ve got a little project, or a big project with a deadline way off in the future, you can collaborate or even hire me. Drop me a line!
