# Hi! I’m Doran!

**About Me:**

While I don't recall being born, I can safely assume that happened. There was most likely a childhood wedged in there somewhere, a teenage phase, some bad facial hair choices, love, marriage, children.... and then the man you see before you now. Well, I mean, not _right now_. Unless you're somehow looking through my website, peering into the fiber optic cables which bind us all, directly into my house through whichever device I’m currently holding. Which is creepy.

Stop that.

I am an illustrator and graphic designer (PUT IN LINKS TO MY WORK). I'm also a musician. (LINKS TO MUSIC PAGE - Public Static, Blues jams... etc.) With those powers combined, I’m also continually broke!

**What's the story behind "whats a doran"?**

Like all great origin stories, this one starts in a bar.

Not terribly long ago (in the grand scheme of things: [https://www.thoughtco.com/world-history-timelines-of-humanity-172901](https://www.thoughtco.com/world-history-timelines-of-humanity-172901 "https://www.thoughtco.com/world-history-timelines-of-humanity-172901")), I was meeting some friends of mine at a bar for a few drinks. It was busy that night, and the bar was pretty large. At some point we became separated. At some point while trying to locate the group, my friends yelled "DORAN!" across the packed bar, to which the very intoxicated gentleman in front of me responded, "..whats the f*#ks a door ran?" before promptly taking a well deserved nap on the bar.

I found this statement hilarious and registered [www.whatsadoran.com](http://www.whatsadoran.com/) the next morning.

Kids - Always take your branding advice from a drunk.

**What’s with the hat?**

What hat?

**Did you always have a beard?**

Technically, the beard has always had me.

**Where do you see yourself in 5 years?**

You sound like my optometrist. Listen, I’m not THAT far sighted, ok? Geez.

If you’ve got a little project, or a big project with a deadline way off in the future, you can collaborate or even hire me. Drop me a line!
