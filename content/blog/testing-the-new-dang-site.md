A phone call with an old friend brought a whole lot of random thoughts to my head.

One of which was how much I longed for the things I used to find mildly irritating. 

_I actually dreamed about picking up my amp and my guitar, and trudging down to my car to go to band practice._

Mind you, I hate that part. I've really got my rig down to a small amount of stuff, and it's lightweight, but _STILL._ Lugging that gear is the worst. But, I miss practice. I miss making music with people. I miss hauling my stuff to gigs. I miss gigs!

Sincerely,

Doran
